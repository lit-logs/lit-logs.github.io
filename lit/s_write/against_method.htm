    I give Against Method by Paul Feyerabend a one out of five stars. Against Method is an incredibly complex and intellectual overview of the science philosopher Paul Feyerabend standpoint on scientific and technological evolution. It critiques methods of scientific and technological study and argues that a more anarchistic ideology on science and technology could replace its original rationality and better the future of the study. This piece of theoretical critique hold other science based philosophies for the responsibility of harmful future events and tears into their beliefs. I did not enjoy reading this one bit because of how difficult and boring this piece of writing was to read, but I do have to respect for how much effort the author puts into his work and beliefs.
