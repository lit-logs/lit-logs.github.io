  <p class="tab">The war in Ukraine has brought serious political, and public tensions all over the world. Some people support the Ukrainian side, while others support the Russian side. 
The majority, as most know, are in favor of the Ukrainians and their over-seeing government. 
However, many people fail to notice the explicitly shown evidence that support the Russian claims of invasion. 
The Russian invasion, is in no way fully justified, but you have to look at the reasoning from their perspective, to be able to formulate an accurate and un-bias opinion. 
A piece of notable behavior observable in individuals who boast pro-Ukrainian opinions, is the constant push for the idea in which they hold. If you hold an opinion,
that doesn't even have to be in support of the Russian reasoning, you are seen as someone who is merely less than human. Apart from the despicable
behavior of many of the Ukrainian sympathizers, they fail to acknowledge pieces of information provided from the Russian side.

Multiple documents have been leaked, which even to this current moment, haven't been accredited with the attention they deserve, that
could be able to completely reformat the public opinion on Ukraine. Unfortunately, with America playing a large, outside role in influencing
the outcome of the invasion for the Russians on the political scale, and most Americans essentially believing what they see, it would be very hard
to turn around the opinion of the general public of America. Apart from why the global, pro-Ukrainian opinions will more than likely never
change, there's pretty credible evidence that shows the use of chemical laboratories in Ukraine, established by the U.S. Public documents have shown
orders of particularly dangerous chemicals, from US organizations, to these accused laboratories. It has been said that these labs are merely
for pathogen research, and not chemical weapons development. This accusation is more on the unstable side because both sides are uniformly supported with
valid evidence. So, either theory could be supported by either side.

<p class="tab">
In the current conflict, it is much better to remain neutral, than support either side. It's just not viable anymore in today's society, to hold
a one-sided opinion, because it only creates division within the people.
