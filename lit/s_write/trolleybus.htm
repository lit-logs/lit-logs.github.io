  <b>Trolleybuses and their Beneficial Role in Public Transport</b>

    The majority of public transportation, especially in the US consists of diesel or battery-electric buses.
	Transportation analysts and enthusiasts alike have thought about the idea of Trolleybuses at least once.
	Apart from that, trolleybuses display both obvious and subtle advantages over normal forms of transportation.
	On the global scale, they help combat air pollution. Trolleybuses are electric, and are powered by overhead wires
	that carry a variety of voltage levels. Many argue battery-electric buses can accomplish the same. This is true,
	however many also fail to acknowledge the fact batteries need to be recharged, or in some cases, replaced. The disposal
	of these batteries is what can also lead to pollution in the long term.

    Trolleybuses are much easier to use as well. They don't need to be charged, as even if they have batteries, they are charged
	by the overhead catenary when the trolleybus drives. Being able to have the ability to charge onboard batteries as well as directly
	power drive motors leads to less downtime, which means more time on the road transporting passengers. Trolleybuses benefit passengers
	as well. They are much quieter, which means they can be used in more suburban areas if needed, while still keeping the same peace
	of the neighborhood.

  <p class="tab">
	One could argue however, that the required costs to build all of the extra catenary, poles to hold the catenary, and whatever
	changes that need to be made to a substation or on site power generation to power the catenary, will be unreasonable and to
	costly to make trolleybuses reasonable. Many trolleybus catenaries are powered by specialized traction substations, that take
	in 35 kV AC, and put it onto the catenaries at 500 - 750 Volts DC. This is usually the most costly piece of construction on
	a trolleybus system, but pays itself off in the long run because of the eliminated costs of diesel fuel, or the eliminated cost
	of replacement batteries.

	From a maintenance perspective, trolleybuses offer easier maintenance as well. While not as easy as battery-electric buses, where its
	essentially a battery connected to a computer, connected to some motors, its still offers the same, if not lower maintenance costs
	including maintenance that is required for the catenaries. Trolleybuses though, are definitely fit for more diverse, and populated areas.
	There are many small towns, and even villages, that had a trolleybus system though, but unfortunately the majority do not remain in service.
	Trolleybus net profits could be inferred to increase in populated areas where passenger amounts would be exponentially higher. For example, if
	you had two routes, one in a town, and one in a city, both 10km long, and running one trolleybus each, which one would make more money? This
	would obviously be the route in the city. This is because we can also assume ticket costs per person are 2 dollars each. Since the city is
	more populated, there will be 150 daily riders, totaling to $300 dollars made, while the town had only 75 daily riders, totalling to $150 dollars made.
	Maintenance costs will remain the same for each line as well, as they both are the same length, just in different areas.

	Here, we can see a basic overview of how effective trolleybuses can be in both urban and city environments. They are much easier to maintain,
	they are much easier on our climate, and they are also cheaper (long-term) as well. Many US cities no longer operate trolleybuses, in favor of
	diesel or battery-electric, ignoring the idea of taking a few steps back, and looking towards older technology, we can improve on in fact, to fit our
	every day transportation needs.
