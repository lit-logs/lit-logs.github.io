<p class="tab">As many military enthusiasts may know, there a many types of vehicles, most notably tanks, helicopters, and aircraft carriers.
    However, there is a very crucial vehicle in most military arsenals, that bridges the gap between tank, and regular infantry. The APC,
    or armored personnel carrier. The armored personnel carrier has played a majorily important role on the battlefields of modern times.
    Especially in urban environments, APCs can allow for the safe transport of troops from point A to point B. To aid with the defense of
    the troops on board, most APCs are modified, or designed to have some sort of anti-infantry weapon either mounted on a turret, onto
    a cupola, or directly onto the APC itself.

<p class="tab">
	One of the most notable APCs, or line of APC I find the most interesting is the line of BTR(бронетранспортёр/armored personnel carrier) APCs.
There are a total of 10 different kinds of BTRs, not including a few sub-varients. The most common characteristic held by Russian APCs, is the use
of wheels, usually 4 wheels on each side, instead of tracks. There are tons of evidence pointing towards wheels being the better option for APCs.
It has been shown, with wheels, it causes much less damage to roads, they are much faster, and are much cheaper in terms of fuel. Apart from the
benefits of wheeled APCs, the BTR-80 has a very strong competator, the M113. The M113 is an American 1960's APC, which was put to use in Vietnam.
It was incredibly cheap to produce, and very modifiable, which made it so versatile for the battlefields encountered in Vietnam. The amount of M113
varients allows for the M113 to be very adaptable to it's deployed area. This is why it is still being used in some places, but will be replaced by
the upcoming AMPV (Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle) program.

	APCs are what bridge the gap between soviet-era infantry carrying trucks, and tank. Without them, countless lives would be lost due to the poor protection
of troops, when being moved from one point to another.
