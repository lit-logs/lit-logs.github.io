    This is a website to store different sorts of literary works. Some of the literature, or writings listed on here may be sensitive as they
    may pertain to events, or ideologies that could offend some people. I don't agree with everything that is put on this site. This site
    is to preserve notable documents that may be able to be used in the future.
